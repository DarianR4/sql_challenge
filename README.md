## Overview

The task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. Using six CSV files, I'll design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.

Data Engineering + Data Analysis 

Note: You may hear the term "Data Modeling" in place of "Data Engineering," but they are the same terms. Data Engineering is the more modern wording instead of Data Modeling.
